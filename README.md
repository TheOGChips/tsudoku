# sudoku-tui

This will be a user-friendly implementation of the classic game of sudoku that you can play in your terminal. As such, it will be all text-based, but should be extremely easy to play. More in-depth explanations as far as how to play the game will be provided, assuming I remember to do so (I'm currently going through graduate school, so it's very likely that I'll forget to update this or will go long stretches of time without any updates).

# Status update: 20 January 2023

The code refactoring has been completed. This resulted in a much bigger cleanup than I expected (I had much more duplicate and unneeded than I realized), but hopefully the code overall will be easier to follow now. As far as I can tell, the code still works the same as it did before, so I'm going to push on.

Up next is one last thing regarding the in-game menu: Being able to toggle it on or off depending on whether the user thinks they will need it or not. After that, I'll do a merge to main and then start a new branch for saving and loading puzzles.
