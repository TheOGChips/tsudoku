# sudoku-tui

This will be a user-friendly implementation of the classic game of sudoku that you can play in your terminal. As such, it will be all text-based, but should be extremely easy to play. More in-depth explanations as far as how to play the game will be provided, assuming I remember to do so (I'm currently going through graduate school, so it's very likely that I'll forget to update this or will go long stretches of time without any updates).

# Status update: 16 January 2023

The menus are now mostly finished. From the main menu, users to see how many puzzles they've solved and start a new game. From the in-game menu, users can read the rules of sudoku and read the game's manual. The only thing lacking is still the ability to save and load unfinished games, but that'll have to wait a bit longer. I've decided to go back and refactor the row, column, and submatrix code partially to (hopefully) make it more readable and partially because it would be a great opportunity to do some slightly more advanced OOP in C++, which I'm a little rusty on. After that's done, I'll return to working getting saving and resuming games working. There might be some last touch-ups after that, but after that, this project should finally be finished.

On a side note, another semester of grad school has started, so who knows if I'll have the time to finish this thing before the end of the semester in May.
