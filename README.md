# sudoku-tui

This will be a user-friendly implementation of the classic game of sudoku that you can play in your terminal. As such, it will be all text-based, but should be extremely easy to play. More in-depth explanations as far as how to play the game will be provided, assuming I remember to do so (I'm currently going through graduate school, so it's very likely that I'll forget to update this or will go long stretches of time without any updates).

# Status update: 10 January 2023

After taking a break in the middle of last semester, I've finally added some final code to the main game. The game appears to be playable and capable of analyzing whether the puzzle has been completed and reports that result back to the player. For all intents and purposes, a puzzle can be played and solved.

Next, I'll work on the in-game menu, to include saving and resuming games as well as keeping a running count of how many puzzles the user has solved. This, hopefully, shouldn't take long to implement and should be the final bit of code to add.
