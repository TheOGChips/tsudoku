# sudoku-tui

This will be a user-friendly implementation of the classic game of sudoku that you can play in your terminal. As such, it will be all text-based, but should be extremely easy to play. More in-depth explanations as far as how to play the game will be provided, assuming I remember to do so (I'm currently going through graduate school, so it's very likely that I'll forget to update this or will go long stretches of time without any updates).

# Status update: 21 January 2023

The in-game menu can also now be toggled on or off depending on whether the user thinks they will need it or not.

Up next will be saving and loading saved games. This is hopefully the last potentially difficult part left. After that's finished, I'll work on any remaining TODO's left anywhere throughout the code.
