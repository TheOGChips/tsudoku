.SS Description
.sp
tsudoku (both short for “terminal sudoku” and inspired phonetically by other Japanese words such as “tsunami”) is a user\-friendly implementation of the classic game of sudoku that you can play in your terminal.
.SS Supported systems
.sp
The below operating systems have been tested for working condition. Other Unix\-based OSs are also likely to also be supported.

\- Debian Linux\- MacOS\- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

.sp
\fBNote for MacOS users\fP: It’s possible that certain (e.g. the Makefile and this README) will be marked as executable during the install process and prevent you from easily viewing the file in a text editor. Alternative ways to view the files marked this way include the Unix command line utility \fBless\fP or terminal\-based text editors such as \fBvim\fP/\fBview\fP or \fBnano\fP\&. The easiest and simplest to use is \fBless\fP\&. Examples are below:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB$ less README.md\fP\fB$ view README.md\fP\fB$ nano \-v README.md\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNote for inexperienced WSL users\fP: tsudoku will not be compilable or playable unless a WSL shell is opened first. A WSL shell should be easily accessible from either a PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt by running \fBwsl.exe\fP at the current terminal prompt. Also see the example below. If you are unsure how to install or setup WSL, please reference https://learn.microsoft.com/en\-us/windows/wsl/install .

.SS Status update: 3 March 2023
.sp
tsudoku is now ready for official release! Barring any potential future bug fixes, this will be the last update until either the documentation is finished or this project has been officially added to the Debian APT repository. Anyone is welcome to notify me of a bug fix by email at: swindell.christian.g@gmail.com . If you have played tsudoku and enjoyed your experience, and you feel obligated to compensate me for my time working on this, you can also email me to ask about setting up a one\-time donation. Have fun playing!
